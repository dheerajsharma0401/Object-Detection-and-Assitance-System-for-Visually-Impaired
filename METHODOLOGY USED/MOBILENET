The MobileNet model is based on depthwise separable convolutions which are a form of factorized convolutions. These factorize a standard
convolution into a depthwise convolution and a 1 × 1 convolution called a pointwise convolution. For MobileNets, the depthwise convolution
applies a single filter to each input channel. The pointwise convolution then applies a 1 × 1 convolution to combine the outputs of the 
depthwise convolution. A standard convolution both filters and combines inputs into a new set of outputs in one step. The depthwise 
separable convolution splits this into two layers – a separate layer for filtering and a separate layer for combining. 
This factorization has the effect of drastically reducing computation and model size.
