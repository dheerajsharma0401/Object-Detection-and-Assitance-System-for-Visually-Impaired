1)INSTALL TENSORFLOW OBJECT DETECTION APIS FROM 
https://github.com/tensorflow/models

2)DOWNLOAD GOOGLE PROTOBUF RELEASES AND CONVERT THE PROTOC FIE TO .PY PYTHON FILES WITH THE HELP OF THE FOLLOWING COMMAND.
protoc -I=$SRC_DIR --python_out=$DST_DIR $SRC_DIR/addressbook.proto
and MAKE SURE TO ADD THE PATH OF THE PROTOC BIN FILE TO THE ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES.

3)RUN THE CODE FROM "object_detection_webcam.py" TO USE MASK RCNN MODEL TO GIVE A BETTER ACCURACY AND IT PERFORMS ONLY REAL TIME BASED OBJECT DETECTION 

4)FOR REAL TIME OBJECT DETECTION ALONG WITH DISTANCE AND VOICE MODULE GENERATION USE "webcam_blind_voice.py " AND IT USES SSD_MOBILENET MODEL. YOU CAN CHANGE
THE MODEL IF NEEDED FROM THE CODE AND USE THE FOLLOWING WEBSITE TO ACCESS ALL THE MODELS.
https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md
IF YOU HAVE A GPU BASED SYSTEM THAT WILL BE AN ADDED ADVANTAGE
